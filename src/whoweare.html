								<p>1966 Chevrolet Chevelle SS – STK 2801</p>
								<p>The 1966 Chevelle SS396 captivated onlookers with its striking appearance.
									The revamped Fisher body ushered in a new era for the mid-size Chevy,
									establishing it as a performance icon. In this iteration, the SS396 evolved
									into a distinct model within the Chevelle lineup, showcasing numerous styling
									upgrades and an unwavering focus on performance.</p>
								<p>This ‘138’ code Chevelle SS396 underwent an impressive frame-off restoration
									in 2013, emerging as a visual masterpiece. A professional application of
									Bolero Red paint revitalized the exterior, complemented by a meticulous
									restoration of the interior in original red vinyl. Every authentic detail,
									including the Muncie ‘hypodermic’ shifter, was thoughtfully recreated. The
									cabin features a complete set of SunPro gauges alongside a column-mounted
									tachometer, tinted windows, and an aftermarket AM/FM/cassette stereo system.</p>
								<p>Under the hood, the original 396ci ‘Rat’ powerplant gave way to a robust
									427ci big-block. This powerhouse, meticulously rebuilt, boasts an aluminum
									intake, dual-line Holley carburetor, and a street-savvy cam. Paired with a
									4-speed manual transmission, the throaty exhaust note resonates with power.
									(Trivia: A few years later, Don Yenko Chevrolet in Pittsburgh adopted a
									similar drivetrain package for their COPO Chevelles.)</p>
								<p>GM Rally wheels with trim rings and centers embrace sturdy 15”
									BFG Radial T/A tires. Steering is managed manually, while power disc/drum
									brakes, a front sway bar, and HD shocks contribute to a balanced driving
									experience.</p>
